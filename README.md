# Mortality Rate Prediction with Machine Learning

This project applies various machine learning models to predict **age-specific mortality rates** using real-world global health data from the **Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME)**. The models include both baseline and ensemble methods, evaluated using appropriate metrics and cross-validation techniques.

---

## Objective

To compare and evaluate the performance of **baseline regressors** and **ensemble learning models** for predicting mortality rates per 100,000 people, based on age, country, sex, and year.

## Evaluation Metrics

- **MAE**: Mean Absolute Error  
- **RMSE**: Root Mean Squared Error  
- **R² Score**: Coefficient of Determination  
- **Runtime**: Total training time in seconds  
- **Evaluation**: `10-Fold CV` or `80/20 Split` as specified per model  

---

## Model Highlights

- SVR uses an **80/20 Split** to match Weka’s behavior and reduce training time.
- All other models use **10-Fold Cross-Validation** for better reliability.
- Ensemble methods tend to outperform baseline models on most metrics.
- Random Forest feature importance is used to explain predictive drivers.
